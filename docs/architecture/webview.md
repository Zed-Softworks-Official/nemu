# nemu-web — Next.js / Convex / Clerk Architecture

nemu-web is the account layer and the UI. It is deliberately thin: the
controller's API is the product; the webview renders it. Convex and Clerk
exist to answer two questions the controller can't answer alone — _who is this
user?_ and _how do I reach my controller when I'm not home?_

Planned location: `apps/web` (sibling of `apps/core`).

## 1. What lives in the cloud — and what never does

Convex schema (full definitions in [data-model.md](data-model.md)):

| Table           | Contents                                                                     | Why it's safe                                                      |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `controllers`   | opaque controller ID, public key, self-reported name, registration timestamp | no home data; the name is user-chosen ("Home")                     |
| `pairings`      | userId ↔ controllerId binding, created timestamp                             | IDs only                                                           |
| `relayMessages` | ephemeral command/response envelopes, TTL, consumed flag                     | opaque to other users, deleted by scheduled cleanup within minutes |

**Never in Convex:** device inventories, friendly names, rooms, scenes, state,
telemetry, history, voice anything. The schema has no fields for them; adding
one is a privacy-review event.

Clerk holds account identity (email, sessions). Convex functions get the user
via Clerk-issued JWTs — standard `ConvexProviderWithClerk` wiring.

## 2. App structure

│   │   ├── lan.ts              # fetch/WS against the controller API
│   │   ├── relay.ts            # Convex-mailbox transport
│   │   └── discovery.ts        # nemu.local probe + candidate scan

│   └── auth.config.ts          # Clerk JWT issuer
└── middleware.ts               # clerkMiddleware protecting /home, /setup
```

Convex conventions per house rules: every public function has `args`/`returns`
validators, auth checks via a shared `authedQuery`/`authedMutation` custom
function wrapper, indexes on all lookup paths (`by_controller`,
`by_user`, `by_controller_and_consumed`).

## 3. Controller discovery

Browsers cannot do raw mDNS, so discovery is layered:

1. **Remembered address** from a previous session (localStorage) — instant.
2. **`nemu.local` probe** — the controller advertises `_nemu._tcp` and most
   home OSes resolve `.local`; the webview fetches
   `http://nemu.local:3000/api/health` with a short timeout.
3. **Manual entry** — user types the IP shown by the controller (CLI/log line
   in v1); always available, discovery is a convenience not a dependency.

The health/identify response includes the controller ID and name so the setup
wizard can show "Found: Home (nemu-3f9a)" before pairing.

## 4. Pairing flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant W as Webview
    participant CV as Convex
    participant C as nemu-core

    Note over C,CV: Boot (once): controller registers ID + public key
    C->>CV: httpAction registerController

    U->>W: Sign in (Clerk)
    W->>C: discover + GET /api/identify
    C-->>W: {controllerId, name}
    U->>C: trigger pairing code (button/CLI)
    C->>C: mint 6-digit code (5 min, single-use)
    U->>W: enter code
    W->>C: POST /api/pair {code, clientLabel}
    C-->>W: {clientToken}  — stored client-side only
    W->>CV: pairings.create({controllerId})
    CV-->>W: pairing recorded (enables relay + other devices)
    W->>C: authenticated LAN session (token header / WS)
```

Key properties:

- The **client token never touches Convex** during pairing — it goes straight
  from controller to browser and is stored client-side.
- The Convex pairing record contains only `{userId, controllerId}`. Its job is
  relay addressing ("which mailbox is mine?") and listing your controllers on
  a new device. A new device still needs to pair (enter a code) to get its own
  token — the cloud record alone grants nothing.
- Unpairing = revoke the token on the controller (`DELETE /api/tokens/{id}`)
  and delete the Convex record.

## 5. Connection manager

`ControllerConnection` exposes one interface to the UI
(`getDevices`, `sendCommand`, `onEvent`, `status`) over two transports:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Probing
    Probing --> Lan: health OK + token accepted
    Probing --> Relay: LAN unreachable
    Lan --> Probing: WS drops / requests failing
    Relay --> Lan: background reprobe succeeds
    Relay --> Offline: relay send times out
    Offline --> Probing: retry timer
```

- **LAN mode:** REST + `/ws` directly against the controller. Full-fidelity
  live state.
- **Relay mode:** `relay.send` Convex mutation writes a command envelope; a
  Convex subscription (`useQuery` on responses) delivers the reply; periodic
  state snapshots are requested rather than streaming every event. UI shows
  `Connected — Remote` and hides latency-sensitive affordances (e.g. live
  slider drag becomes commit-on-release).
- Envelope payloads carry the client token; the controller verifies it before
  executing (see [core.md](core.md) §6). Responses are signed with the
  controller key so the client can detect a spoofed relay.

## 6. Relay implementation sketch (Convex)

- `relay.send(controllerId, payload)` — authed mutation; checks the caller has
  a `pairings` row for `controllerId`; inserts a `relayMessages` row
  `{controllerId, direction: "toController", payload, expiresAt}`.
- Controller subscription — the controller long-polls/subscribes via an authed
  HTTP action for unconsumed `toController` messages, marks them consumed, and
  inserts `toClient` responses.
- `relay.responses(requestIds)` — reactive query the webview subscribes to.
- **Cleanup cron** — a scheduled Convex function deletes consumed rows
  immediately and any row past `expiresAt` (minutes). This job is part of the
  privacy contract, not an optimization.

## 7. HTTPS and mixed content

The webview is served over HTTPS (Vercel) but the controller speaks HTTP on
the LAN in early milestones — browsers block that mixed content. Mitigation
sequence:

- **M2 spike:** decide between (a) controller-served self-signed cert with a
  trust-on-first-use install page, (b) `*.nemu.home`-style local CA, or
  (c) treating relay as the transport whenever the cert isn't trusted yet.
- Until resolved, dev happens on `http://localhost` (no mixed-content rule)
  and the wizard offers relay mode as the fallback path. M5 hardens this
  properly (TLS + pinning).
